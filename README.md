## Description
I designed this program to help make an well structured and efficient readme.md. Especially in the begining of you programing journey a good readme can be difficult to make. I had that problem of what to include and how much to write. With this program I take the thinking out of your readme.It already has the correct heading implemented into the program but it also asks you prompts to guide you on what to write.
